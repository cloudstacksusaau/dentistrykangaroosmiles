<h1>How to Choose the Best Pediatric Dentist for Your Family</h1>
<p>
  Beginning regular dental care for your child at a young age can affect their oral health for life.  This is why it’s so important that children become familiar with regular dental exams and cleanings as soon as possible. However, not all children are comfortable with these procedures. Many children are scared of going to the dentist, which can often carry over into adulthood and affect their overall health for years to come. 

How then, can parents and caregivers go about finding the best pediatric dentist to help establish lifelong healthy oral hygiene habits? When Dr. Mona Beylin started Kangaroo Smiles, she sought to change the perception associated with dentistry to create an environment that children can actually enjoy while providing the best possible dental care.
